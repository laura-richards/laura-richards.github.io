          HTML, CSS and JavaScript can easily feel like a lot to learn. So lets
          break down some of the things some of the things it is helpful to know
          when starting out.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h3>
          JavaScript, HTML and CSS - What are they and how do the relate to each
          other?
        </h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            JavaScript, HTML and CSS are all programming languages that can be
            used together to create webpages. They can all be used in one file,
            but this is not best practice, but more commonly we create a file in
            each of them and use links between them to create what you see on
            the screen. Each one has a different function.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>HTML:</strong> Some describe HTML as the builder. It is made
            up of 'tags' which contain the content for the page within them. The
            tags help to identify what the content is, for example is this a
            heading, or an article, or a link to another page. This is like the
            base for the page, and from there the other languages make changes
            to the appearance of the content and page.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>CSS:</strong> CSS could be called the artist in this trio of
            languages. CSS gives the web browser the instructions about how they
            should display the content held in the HTML file. It controls things
            like size, colour and proximity to other content.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript could be called the
            magician. It works on how the user can interact with the page and
            can make things change in the HTML and CSS, for example it can react
            to clicks, or keystrokes, it can change what is in the HTML content,
            or what classes are acting on different parts which then could
            change how it appears. It can also let us put things like
            calculators or forms on our webpages.

        <h3>Just going with the flow? - Control flow and loops</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            <strong>Control flow:</strong> relates to the order in which the
            computer works through the content of a script(or JavaScript file).
            Code runs from top to bottom unless it comes across something that
            changes or interrupts the flow.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Loops:</strong> One thing that changes the flow are loops, a
            loops asks the browser to repeat an action, or series of actions
            until the stated conditions are met. A basic loop ask for the same
            thing to be repeated until a set condition is met, a slightly more
            complicated loop might do two different things depending on certain
            conditions, and in even more complicated codes you can have a loop
            in a loop.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Applying it to life outside the computer:</strong> While it
            is embarrassingly domestic I am going to use folding washing as my
            example of a loop in everyday life. Lets say you have done a load
            that is all towels, folding this could be an example of a simple
            loop. You take a towel, fold it, put it in pile, grab the next towel
            and repeat until there are no more towels to fold. Written as a code
            this 'could' look like this:
          </p>
          <img
            src="../../img/forLoopCode.png"
            alt="Basic Loop Code"
            class="code-image"
          />
          <p>
            To make it a little more complicated we might also have some clothes
            in there which we are leaving for later. The code representation
            might look like this:
          </p>
          <img
            src="../../img/IfElseCode.png"
            alt="If-Else Loop"
            class="code-image"
          />
          <p>
            Or maybe it has been some time since you did the folding and
            mount-washmore is threatening to collapse all over the floor... the
            loop might look something like this as you pop each persons clothes
            in baskets for them to sort in their rooms and fold the rest.
          </p>
          <img
            src="../../img/IfElseIfElseCode.png"
            alt="If-else if-else Loop"
            class="code-image"

        <h3>The DOM - What is it and how might you interact with it?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            <strong>The DOM:</strong> When first starting on this journey the
            DOM felt a little bit daunting and a lot to get my head around.
            Hopefully I can outline it a little here to help it be a little bit
            more clear. So DOM stands for Document Object Mode. Breaking that
            down and looking at each of the words we start with document, and in
            this case we are looking at how the browser is seeing information we
            have given it, it is seeing a document that it is to read in its
            window.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we have object, which is how the browser is seeing the
            information in that document, it is a document with objects inside
            it, this gives us both some information about how the information is
            structured to the dom and how to interact with it. The structure is
            often described as a tree, with the window at the top, then the
            document, then all the other pieces coming from that. In this
            structure each item in the structure comes from one parent, ie the
            body flows down from the document, and the div inside the body flow
            from the body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally we come to model, and this is letting us know that it is a
            representation or framework for that information.
          </p>
          <p>
            While that might be as clear as mud for you still, an important take
            away is that the DOM is a tool we can use with our webpages to
            change information or appearance, or make them interactive.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Interacting with the DOM:</strong> We can use JavaScript to
            edit the HTML of our page when users interact with the page by
            moving the mouse over things, click on something, or on keystroke.
            We can do this either in the developer tools on a webpage, or
            through our JavaScript file.

        <h3>Need to store something? Figuring out Arrays and Objects</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Arrays and objects are both ways to store information.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Arrays</strong> are structured as a list of things. These
            things can be strings, numbers, other arrays, or objects. Arrays are
            denoted with [] and each item is given an index(i) number based on
            where it sits in the array, starting with [0] for the first item.
            You can use these index numbers to access the information in the
            array.
          </p>
          <img src="../../img/Array.png" alt="Array Code" class="code-image" />
          <p>
            <strong>Objects</strong> store information also, but in a different
            way, in an object items are stored with a key and a value. You can
            then use the key to access the value. Objects are denoted with {}.
          </p>
          <img
            src="../../img/object.png"
            alt="Object Code"
            class="code-image"
          />

      </div>
      <div class="textBlocks">
        <h3>
          Is it functional? Functions, what are they and how do they help?
        </h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            <strong>Functions</strong> are like building blocks of code. They
            look a little like this in their base form:
          </p>
          <img src="../../img/functionCode.png" alt="Functions Code Example" />
          <p>
            After declearing that we are creating a function we give the
            function a name, specify any parameters we will pass to it, and then
            in curly braces we tell it what it should do.
          </p>
          <p>
            To return to our washing example, the foldTowel() function might
            look something like the code below. Where for each towel we would
            have instructions of how to fold it.
          </p>
          <img src="../../img/towelFunction.png" alt="Towel Function Example" />
          <p><strong>How do they help?</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li class="bullet-points">
              We can use them in several different places with only having to
              call them rather than rewriting all of the code again and reduces
              likelihood of errors.
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-points">
              They help improve code readability(if done well)
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-points">
              They can be tested as small bits and debugged in small bits rather
              than if was all written out at every use
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-points">
              Inbuilt functions save us time as they are already made for us and
              ready to implement in our code.
