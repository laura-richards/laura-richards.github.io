          HTML, CSS and JavaScript can easily feel like a lot to learn. So lets
          break down some of the things some of the things it is helpful to know
          when starting out.

          JavaScript, HTML and CSS - What are they and how do the relate to each
          other?
        </h3>

          <p>
            JavaScript, HTML and CSS are all programming languages that can be
            used together to create webpages. They can all be used in one file,
            but this is not best practice, but more commonly we create a file in
            each of them and use links between them to create what you see on
            the screen. Each one has a different function.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>HTML:</strong> Some describe HTML as the builder. It is made
            up of 'tags' which contain the content for the page within them. The tags help to identify what the content is, for example is this a heading, or an article, or a link to another page. This is like the base for the page, and from there the other languages make changes to the appearance of the content and page. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>CSS:</strong> CSS could be called the artist in this trio of languages. CSS gives the web browser the instructions about how they should display the content held in the HTML file. WIT controls things like size, color and proximity to other content.</p>
          <p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript could be called the magician. It works on how the user can interact with the page and can make things change in the HTML and CSS, for example it can react to clicks, or keystrokes, it can what is in the HTML content, or what classes are acting on different parts which then could change how it appears</p>
