          <h3>Inline</h3>
          <p>
            To display inline means to display along side other elements/content, or 
            within them without interrupting the flow of the elements.
            It is the default for a few common elements such as
            <span class="elements">span</span>, <span class="elements">a</span>,
            <span class="elements">em</span>, and
            <span class="elements">strong</span>. When elements are displayed
            <span class="inlineExample">inline</span> they will ignore any
            margin applied to the top or bottom, and any height elements given,
            they do accept the padding given on top and bottom but it doesn't
            impact on the other elements around them. As you can see my code
            below for the word inline above is specifying its height, margin,
            and padding on each side. However, the margin is only applied to the
            left and right of the box. The padding is applied all around but it
            does not change where the words around it are, or the spacing of the
            lines, as you can see with the red line cutting through the words
            above above/below. It is also ignoring the height specification.

          <h3>Inline Block</h3>
          <p>
            To display in inline block means to display alongside other elements
            rather than forcing a break after, but within more style-able blocks.
            When elements are displayed
            <span class="inlineBlockExample">inline block</span> they will
            follow any top and bottom margin and padding, and this will act on
            the other content around them. As you can see my code for the words
            inline block is specifying a margin, and padding on each side just
            like it was for inline above. But this time the content
            above(depending on your screen-size) and below is impacted and as a
            result the gap between the lines of text is larger than in other
            places. This is because rather than doing a more complicated
            wrapping involving just the spot "inline block" is, it impacts the
            whole lines more to make it easier to read and navigate.

          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
            In summary inline and inline block are pretty similar in that they
            allow content to appear along-side other content on a page. The main
            difference is that with inline block you have the ability to alter
            the margin on the top and bottom, and the height of the element. Inline is 
            useful for when adding things within blocks of content, like links to other 
            pages or places on a page for example. Where as inline block is great when you
            want to have elements on a page next to each other, or wrapping down a page, but 
            also want to be able to style their top and bottom margin, padding, and their height.
