      <h2>Week one: 24<sup>th</sup> to 30<sup>th</sup> April</h2>
      <p>As last week had been very busy with the girls I had only got to computer set up on Sunday and then it threw a couple of curve balls my way. I found myself needing to post up a help request on the first morning, and then a second one later, which was a good exercise in both asking for help and recognising my ego struggles around not knowing a thing and being visible in it. 
        This is definitely an area for me to be aware of and work on over this course. Once my comp was all set up and I was on to the course materials things went smoothly, I enjoyed making mistakes and then figuring out how to correct them. Having not worked in the command line at all before it was so fun to navigate that. One thing that has been interesting is working out how I am going with getting through the course work on time, I kept forgetting to set my toggl tracker or forgetting to turn it off, so this is a thing that I need to work on more. 
        Balancing the girls needs, household needs and my needs this week has been easy. We have set up a table next to my desk so the girls can work alongside me which is pretty fun. The most challenging thing was probably us all getting off our workspaces when sitting down to do a little more after dinner and getting to bed at good hours.

      <h2>Week two: 1<sup>st</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> May</h2>
      <p>This week I started the week working on my values, strengths, and limitations blog post. I found it interesting that this was something that I was finding I had some blocks with getting started on, I found myself wanting to get through it and into playing with code again. When I sat with this, I came to realise that this was tied into not being sure how much we were expected to write and wanting to get it ‘right’. Identifying this helped me to move through the block and get my words down on paper. After this I checked had got all the reflections and finishing off things sorted for sprint-1 and as still had a couple days left in the sprint got into the stretch material which was good fun learning more about command line and working with a git repository.  Then over the weekend I started to have a look at the sprint-2 work. The freecode camp tutorial was lots of fun to work through and so it quickly was completed. The devtools workshop was a little bit more challenging and I very much want to return to this next week to do some more work on it. I have been setting timers as well as using toggl and this has been great for being more aware of time spent on tasks. 
        Outside of course work this week was a fairly standard week, the girls did more body-doubling with me, I am very much hoping this is not a novelty that wears off fast.

      <h2>Week three: 8<sup>th</sup> to 14<sup>th</sup> May</h2>
      <p>This week started out great, on Monday I got into creating my blog welcome page after thinking on the weekend about what I wanted to include in it. My focus was my want to see if I could create a functional navigation bar and work out how to link the pages, which after a few times of things not working how I thought it would and needing to play with changing things I did.
        Unfortunately, just after this I had a medical event which caused the rest of the week to be a write off for me where I was just resting and recovering. By the time Sunday came around I was really wanting to get back to having energy and focus to get back to the study and very looking forward to making time on Monday to get some done. 
        This week has been a good lesson in putting myself first and not pushing through and keeping doing things.
