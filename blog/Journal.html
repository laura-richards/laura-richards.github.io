        <h3>Week one: 24<sup>th</sup> to 30<sup>th</sup> April</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          As last week had been very busy with the girls I had only got to
          computer set up on Sunday and then it threw a couple of curve balls my
          way. I found myself needing to post up a help request on the first
          morning, and then a second one later, which was a good exercise in
          both asking for help and recognising my ego struggles around not
          knowing a thing and being visible in it. This is definitely an area
          for me to be aware of and work on over this course. Once my comp was
          all set up and I was on to the course materials things went smoothly,
          I enjoyed making mistakes and then figuring out how to correct them.
          Having not worked in the command line at all before it was so fun to
          navigate that. One thing that has been interesting is working out how
          I am going with getting through the course work on time, I kept
          forgetting to set my toggl tracker or forgetting to turn it off, so
          this is a thing that I need to work on more. Balancing the girls
          needs, household needs and my needs this week has been easy. We have
          set up a table next to my desk so the girls can work alongside me
          which is pretty fun. The most challenging thing was probably us all
          getting off our workspaces when sitting down to do a little more after
          dinner and getting to bed at good hours.

        <h3>Week two: 1<sup>st</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> May</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          This week I started the week working on my values, strengths, and
          limitations blog post. I found it interesting that this was something
          that I was finding I had some blocks with getting started on, I found
          myself wanting to get through it and into playing with code again.
          When I sat with this, I came to realise that this was tied into not
          being sure how much we were expected to write and wanting to get it
          ‘right’. Identifying this helped me to move through the block and get
          my words down on paper. After this I checked had got all the
          reflections and finishing off things sorted for sprint-1 and as still
          had a couple days left in the sprint got into the stretch material
          which was good fun learning more about command line and working with a
          git repository. Then over the weekend I started to have a look at the
          sprint-2 work. The freecode camp tutorial was lots of fun to work
          through and so it quickly was completed. The devtools workshop was a
          little bit more challenging and I very much want to return to this
          next week to do some more work on it. I have been setting timers as
          well as using toggl and this has been great for being more aware of
          time spent on tasks. Outside of course work this week was a fairly
          standard week, the girls did more body-doubling with me, I am very
          much hoping this is not a novelty that wears off fast.

        <h3>Week three: 8<sup>th</sup> to 14<sup>th</sup> May</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          This week started out great, on Monday I got into creating my blog
          welcome page after thinking on the weekend about what I wanted to
          include in it. My focus was my want to see if I could create a
          functional navigation bar and work out how to link the pages, which
          after a few times of things not working how I thought it would and
          needing to play with changing things I did. Unfortunately, just after
          this I had a medical event which caused the rest of the week to be a
          write off for me where I was just resting and recovering. By the time
          Sunday came around I was really wanting to get back to having energy
          and focus to get back to the study and very looking forward to making
          time on Monday to get some done. This week has been a good lesson in
          putting myself first and not pushing through and keeping doing things.

        <h3>Week four: 15<sup>th</sup> to 21<sup>st</sup> May</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          It was great to feel up to getting back to study at the start of this
          week, however the state of the small and not so small humans in my
          life had the first two days a little challenging when it came to
          making time to get on the computer for more than 5minute blocks.
          Initially I felt the weight to get dones on Monday but then remembered
          that I am doing this course this way so that I can still be there for
          the kids and that I needed to trust myself and be realistic about the
          workload rather than putting my extra nice to learn stuff and
          experiment with stuff. I noticed over the course of the week that I
          tend to have one day where I am like woohoo I got this and then the
          next day I am more like hmmm I know nothing and will continue to know
          nothing unless I find all the hours. I have noticed this before when
          dealing with tricky situations so lucky I am pretty good at riding
          those waves. Later in the week things were more chill with the kiddos
          and while I didnt finish sprint-2 by Friday afternoon like I hoped to,
          I did get it to what felt like an acceptable point by later that
          night. Interestingly taking the pressure off by handing in what was
          hopefully good enough lead to me getting up early Saturday and
          improving on some of the code I was most unhappy with and doing more
          over the course of the day. The weekend was pretty hectic and loud
          here as it was the middliest birthday party and so she had 4 friends
          over Saturday for the night, with another joining the following
          morning for a time. Sunday afternoon and evening was chill and reset
          for the week for us. So I have not done the sprint-3 prep that was my
          plan but all and all feeling good.

        <h3>Week five: 22<sup>nd</sup> to 28<sup>th</sup> May</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          On Monday two of the 5 kiddos came down with the flu and that ended up
          setting the tone for the week. While only three of the kids got it, it
          was a doozy so there was a lot of work to be done supporting the girls
          and slotting in course around that. I felt like I was waiting to be
          taken down but fortunately I wasn't and fortunately the eldest also
          managed to isolate from those that were sick and stay healthy, which
          she was very motivated to do as she had a weekend away booked. The
          core work was fun this week, it is lovely to get to know others in the
          cohort more. The JS challengers were great, I really enjoyed working
          out the last two loops, I the suggested resources after have been
          great to work through. After learning more about ChatGBT I have been
          using that more to help me find those little errors driving me batty.
          Tis great!

        <h3>Week six: 29<sup>th</sup> May to 5<sup>th</sup> June</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          Illness dragged on into the first half of this week, then we had a
          friend visiting for rest of the week so been another busy one this
          week. Course wise, the DOM challenges flew by, it was so cool to see
          how much I had picked up, the JS cafe base work was a lot of fun, I
          challenged myself to try the things then learn how they should be done
          and it was very enjoyable. With there not being clear pauses on when
          to stop I wasn't sure how it was meant to be, but this way worked well
          for me. I had such a block with getting the blog done and so that took
          a lot longer than it should have, and as a result I have not got into
          the stretch challenges in the JS cafe or added JS to my blog like I
          would have liked to. So now with the last little bit of the weekend I
          am torn about if I start the next sprint or if I get on to those
          stretches. Oooh I did a little bit of pair programming which was heaps
          of fun also! Will be so much learning in doing that as we go along.

        <h3>Week seven: 6<sup>th</sup> June to 11<sup>th</sup> June</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          This week started with a day focused on getting some of my core work
          done for the week as I have noticed that having all the blogs to do at
          the end of the week really ended up with me having a lot of time
          blocked, but if I use my desire to get into the tech course work to
          help me with my motivation to get through the core blogs this should
          help over come that. I worked and I got the writing for the blogs done
          that day and was then able to move onto the tech work. It was a little
          slow going over the week as was a busy week with the kid. But on
          Friday I was able to get to the JS-kata which was a lot of fun. It is
          quite a blast getting fail after fail and then it finally clicking and
          passing.
          <br />
          I had a child free night friday night and did no course work but
          instead enjoyed a night away at the beach with was great! Saturday
          evening I got back to the kata got it finished which was great! Sunday
          was busy with the girls and rehearsals and I was feeling a bit more
          under the weather so trying to rest to avoid more bugs.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Week eight: 12<sup>th</sup> June to 18<sup>th</sup> June</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          After having got the kata done on the weekend I got into my tech blog
          on Monday and got it done. Which was really good as by Tuesday morning
          I was feeling a bit rough and then soon admitted that I had the flu.
          Tuesday and Wednesday were complete write off's with me just sleeping
          and doing the bare minimum with the girls. Luckily they were amazing
          helping with food prep, making me hot drinks and helping each other
          out. Thursday I was feeling better but took it easy as I have a
          tendency to rush back and delay recovery.
          <br />
          So it was really good that I had the option of taking some time of as
          I managed to have these days off and not end up behind. Friday was
          spend playing with the new module work added to the sprint which was
          really cool to explore with animating things using js. Over the
          weekend I had a read of the sprint 5 work, it looked a little daunting
          so of course I wanted to get into it, especially as it started with
          tic tac toe which the littlest two and I have been playing this a lot
          while I have been doing foundations so really wanted to be able to
          show them that work also.

        <h3>Week nine: 18<sup>th</sup> June to 25<sup>th</sup> June</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          This week started out with flying through the JavaScript Carnival. The
          unicorns provided quite a challenge starting out and that took a bit
          of problem solving work for me, but then getting into whack-a-mole
          things fell into place which was a nice boost. The tail end of the
          week was low on hands on keys time, I planned to watch some youtube
          and do some freeCodeCamp work seeing as was getting through the sprint
          work, but ended up not getting any done, which was a little tricky for
          my brain as then start to feel behind and the weight of to dos, so
          trying to make sure I am being realistic with the messages I am giving
          myself.

        <h3>Week ten: 26<sup>th</sup> June to 2<sup>nd</sup> July</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          Last week of foundations!! It was another very busy week where getting
          time to code was on the low side, I did manage to have some good check
          in's and conversations with others from my cohort which helped a lot
          with head space, I got the last of the code done early in the week,
          and then finished the core work on Friday before heading up to New
          Plymouth for the weekend. With being away for the weekend it meant
          that I couldn't do the stretch work before the end of the sprint but
          it give me something to do for the break.
          <br />
          I have been giving a lot of thought to what I want to focus on over
          the break to be as set up as possible as I can be for bootcamp. I
          really want to work on some css, and some JS work but know I need to
          be realistic about what I can fit into the time. Stay turned to see
          how that goes!
        </p>
      </section>
      <h3>Study Break:</h3>
      <section>
        <h3>Week one: 3<sup>rd</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> July</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          This week started with a great bit of coding. When doing the
          whack-a-mole I had found a tutorial that showed making a countdown
          timer with a coloured animation which I really wanted to make, but I
          didn't have the time during that sprint. So this was my first go to
          this week. The timer bit itself was not to complicated, the making a
          circle shape was very stretchy, I spent a bit of time reading the
          links about making circles and making a path, a lot of it is still
          quite over my head, while I could understand it while reading it I def
          would need to do lots of reading to be able to write it without the
          tutorials help. I ran into quick a challenge with it where I was
          finding that my animation was going backward to what I wanted, with
          playing I could get it to go from the start but it would be doing it
          with the colour not working like I wanted. I asked a friend for help
          and got directed to chatGBT lol so asked chatGBT for some help, this
          helped me learn about how to manipulate the start points but did not
          manage to switch the direction up. Eventually I left this for later.
          <br />
          Next up I went to working on minesweeper. I remember playing this lots
          as a teen so was excited to get into it. It did have some tricky bits,
          like remembering to use the modules properly and getting overwhelmed
          looking at what was in those files, but over all it was pretty good. I
          really enjoyed figuring out how to make it work, and how to turn it
          into a game with options at the start of how many challenging it is or
          the size of the board. I ran into a few things like having the
          function to create the mine list in the wrong place which meant for
          each board it was being created for each cell rather than once, once I
          figured this out I was able to pull apart things a little more to make
          this work like I intended. I think one big take away for me with this
          project was that I need to remember to make smaller functions that
          just do one thing more.
          <br />
          Apart from those to bits of coding I did not manage to do much else
          tech wise this week. A fair bit of the mental and personal time energy
          I had was spend on thinking ahead to the next week, preparing for food
          and other logistics for school holiday programme and also trying to
          make sure the kids were are rested as they could be for that. And also
          getting some rest myself also.

        <h3>Week two: 10<sup>th</sup> to 16<sup>th</sup> July</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          This week was chaos and as exhausting as I expected it to be. So I got
          no time coding or really doing anything outside of school holiday
          program and kids bedtimes etc for the week. We were leaving the house
          between 7 and 7.30 each day and returning between 6 and 7.30 each
          night. The days were filled with sorting children, managing teachers
          so kids got breaks from rehearsals, cleaning, crafting, organising
          costumes etc. It was more of a challenge than last year, maybe because
          there were less days which meant that the teachers were trying to fit
          more into the days. Having the two different shows there definitely
          made a difference too. There was lots of learning for me on speaking
          up, and also on regulating my own emotions in times of uncertainty
          etc. I had some lovely talks with other parents while doing this which
          was very nice. And most importantly my kiddos had a lovely and tiring
          week.
          <br />
          I would have liked to have spent the weekend getting back into code,
          but the kids and I ended up visiting extended family for the day on
          saturday and then getting sorted for the week ahead on Sunday.

        <h3>Week one: 17<sup>th</sup> to 23<sup>rd</sup> July</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          This week has been quite the journey for me. I was really nervous and
          excited leading into Monday, then quickly felt a little overwhelmed
          and nervous about managing the work load with my every day life. I
          loved the idea of an accountability partner but with my schedule it
          was hard to find times to pair code that worked for the both of us,
          which had me feeling very worried about letting others down each week
          due to my availability, or lack there in normal work hours most days.
          I was nervous that I wouldn't have time to watch the lectures before I
          was trying to fit in time with my partner, and so I wouldn't be able
          to pull my weight in the pairing sessions. Thankfully over the course
          of the week I was able to work through these feelings, recognising
          that it is not always expected to pair program, and that my
          accountability partners and I can work out how it works for us, some
          weeks this might be lots of pair time, others not, and that I can
          still work with others. My partner and I got into a wonderful groove
          of messaging a few times a day checking in, talking about life and
          coding and generally encouraging each other. When I got stuck she was
          amazing at helping me problem solve which was really awesome also.
          <br />
          Once I got to watching the lectures and having some time to jump into
          code the code aspects went well. I didn't manage to get to the bonus
          work, but all the standard kata's were great fun and I very much
          enjoyed them. The bowling kata I somehow managed to smash out in a
          short time with it all just flowing beautifully. I would love to
          refactor it and try other ways to solve it as know there are so many
          different ways and so much I could learn from that. But for now this
          is not such a thing. I guess the list of things we would like to spend
          more time on with grow and evolve as we go through more projects. It
          is such an interesting thing not being expected to finish the katas,
          this is something that will take a few going overs to get into my
          head!
          <br />
          Life outside of code has been as hectic as ever this week. We got the
          show schedule for September and it is bigger, with more shows than I
          had expected, and my girls got added to extra casts (which they are
          mixed on as they were looking forward to helping out at the theatre on
          their off casts, but also they are excited by the challenge also). We
          started working on the flats for the set, and also training some of
          the kids that are going to be involved in set moving on stage as we
          want to both make sure that they are well supported and also that it
          is as safe as possible. I managed to also get some time supporting our
          youngest groups in learning their journeys which is great as the lack
          of time to do this has been bothering me plenty. So all in all great
          times, but definitely feeling very aware that the last three weeks of
          this term are going to be much more full on than I realised. I will
          need to talk with the tutors about managing that as had only said one
          week not three to start with! Will need to think about the what and
          hows for the biggest poppets dance for those weeks also. Possibly both
          of us with have lots of work to do in the holidays catching up!

        <h3>Week Two: 24<sup>th</sup> to 30<sup>th</sup> July</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          Monday was the littlest of mines birthday so we had a full house with
          her having four friends over for a birthday dinner and sleep over. It
          was a super late night and everyone including me was a little jaded
          the next day! Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday were busy days with set
          design and painting, which was a lot of fun, it is such a wonderful
          crew working together which makes it really enjoyable.
          <br />
          I was pretty nervous going into the first human skills deep dive not
          knowing what to expect and knowing that I can find group things
          tricky, but it was so great, having small break outs to chat about the
          topics was really great for being about to dive into topics in a safe
          way, and I was lucky to be paired with someone that I have chatted
          with a lot to start with which was really awesome, we had some great
          chats, and then for the last one we had someone new with us which was
          really lovely to as it was a great way to get to know someone else in
          the cohort. I really enjoyed diving into the content, and also the
          videos that were posted in the classroom. <br />
          Code wise I was very blocked to start with when it came to doing the
          art reader. I was excited to jump into the challenge and then when
          getting started I had no clue what to do for a while, I had to read it
          and then walk away to process, and then the same when I was trying to
          get the prompt to work, and the editing the main function. Each time
          once I had walked away for a little and came back to it came together
          much better.

        <h3>Week Three: 31<sup>st</sup> July to 6<sup>th</sup> August</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          I was quite nervous about how diving into new material would be after
          having the two weeks and the holidays of mostly working on revising
          things rather than new material. To start with it all felt so over my
          head with the new terms and acronyms, but jumping into Express Server
          was lots of fun, and I found that the code along lecture really set me
          up well for the task. Adding in handlebars was really cool, I like the
          idea of templating to build up the content, it makes sense to my brain
          which is helpful. I would have liked to have had time to jump into the
          testing of the server-side rendering task so will have that on my list
          for when I get a moment!
          <br />
          Human skills focussed on Te Whare Tapa Wha this week which I really
          enjoyed, it was a great invitation to think of the different aspects
          of wellbeing in ways I had not considered with Sarrah pointing
          examples that dive a little deeper than the surface level that we can
          often sit at when considering wellbeing. It gave me a great
          opportunity to consider my own view of wellbeing and my plan, and
          consider ways to improve upon it (See my blog page for my additions if
          you are interested, hopefully more updates to come as wellbeing is
          always a work in progress right!)
          <br />
          Life outside of course was pretty hectic as always. We had a friend
          stay unexpectedly which was very lovely to see her and get to catch
          up, it is alway just the balance of having enough hours for all ot the
          things! The theatre stuff is ticking along slowly, there is always a
          big list and at the moment I don't really feel like I am finishing any
          tasks. I have stepped by from set a little as there are lots of cooks
          in that kitchen and so sometimes its better if there are less!

        <h3>Week Four: 7<sup>th</sup> to 13<sup>th</sup> August</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          I was really excited to get into puppies at the start of this week. It
          provided plenty of challenges in learning just what data was being
          looked at and how I needed to then work with it so there was a lot of
          time spent console logging things and experimenting which as always I
          loved. I would have liked to have used the code from class less in
          figuring it out, but am being gentle with myself on that. I also was
          pretty focused on getting it done so that when it came to group
          projects I was not also feeling the need to go back and get the weeks
          work done to be able to hold my own.
        </p>
        <br />
        FIRST PROJECT TIME! I was so excited to see how this would work with the
        different timetables and part-time nature. Jumping in to planning with
        my team on Wednesday was such a blast, we had a lot of laughs and really
        took the time to understand where each other was at with code, with time
        available and with aims for the project. Then we got into designing it,
        and doing some code together. None of us had spent much time working
        with much of the git work flow or in code with others so we had lots to
        learn together but it was such a smooth process for us. We ended up
        having lots of opportunities to figure out how git works through
        challenges with accidentally deleting the wrong things etc, I still feel
        like there is a lot to learn here for me, but am sure the other projects
        will be good opportunities and I am also going to make more branches in
        my local projects so that I can practice there as well and get into good
        habits.
        <br />
        Personal life stuff was pretty mixed this week. I was in a bit of a funk
        and feeling the weight of all the to dos in all the different areas of
        my life but not quite sure how to support myself or ask for support from
        others. I was able to keep that mostly away from the kids which is good,
        I really probably need to do a good day of housework to get on top of
        the backlog there and then it might be a bit easier to manage all the
        other things.

        <h3>Week Five: 14<sup>th</sup> to 20<sup>th</sup> August</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          Starting databases was an interesting struggle, I am noticing a
          pattern that when a new topic is introduced I find it very hard to get
          my head around watching the first lecture and get nervous that I am
          not going to get it and then once get fingers on the keys it gets
          easier quickly so I really just need to ride that wave of self-doubt
          to start with and then get into it. I really didn't have time to get
          into code much this week. On monday I watched some of the lectures and
          did a little bit here and there but on Friday I was still on Mondays
          tasks which was a little stressful. I really wanted to listen to Johns
          suggestion that Dreamfest was the most important and so to skip to
          that if behind, but with still not having my head around things I
          found I really wanted to keep working through it in order. I am glad I
          followed what was most comfortable for my brain as otherwise I think I
          would have been working against myself, I managed to still take John
          advice in a way as I stopped activities when I had a good base where
          as I normally would have gone further into it as they were not taking
          too long. I got up to the typescript on the weekend and really enjoyed
          sinking into that. I really hope I can get Fridays work done on Monday
          ready for the project time.
          <br />
          I did get to do a bunch of pair programming one day with a couple of
          course-mates which was great for practice, for diving deeper into my
          understanding, and also for my ego as they were so lovely their
          feedback!
          <br />
          This week has been so busy with theatre stuff, we spent a lot of the
          time out and there were some pressing deadlines and logistics of
          working in varied teams that took up both a lot of brain space and
          physical time and space. I had some time without children on the
          weekend and as was feeling super overwhelmed with all the things on my
          plate so realised I needed to really prioritise some time to relax and
          not think about all the things, which I did Friday evening and a
          little bit of Saturday evening and it was just what I needed. I think
          that this is one thing that I am not very good so it was good to do
          it.

        <h3>Week Six: 21<sup>th</sup> to 27<sup>th</sup> August</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          I got pretty busy with the code work Monday and Tuesday this week as
          really wanted to be in a good place to smash out group projects
          Wednesday and Friday as had mum and my sister coming to stay for the
          weekend and a lot planned for it so knew that I would be low on time.
          It all went pretty smoothly, if was not trying to smash it out for a
          deadline I would have done some going further with each exercise and
          doing the stretch but that was not to be for this week. Group project
          was a little stop start this week, but had a great team and learnt a
          lot through it. Had some growth opportunities sitting with my
          discomfort about not being available when would like to be and needing
          to proritise some personal life things which was good. I learnt heaps
          to about git which is wicked as was very much needed! Hope it sticks
          for next week lol
          <br />
          I needed to take a couple of days off theatre again this week to have
          some balance, but it seems like things are slowly being ticked off
          there, am nearly at the point that I feel like we will have enough
          backstage helpers which is good as there were some big gaps to
          navigate there. The weekend rehearsal went really well which was great
          as was the last one for that cast.
          <br />The family and I had a great time over the weekend, I did need
          to do some course work which they were cool with which was great! We
          went to see Wicked which was amazing, the girls loved it. The week
          ended with doing our group presentation at 10pm Sunday which was a bit
          of a challenge.

        <h3>Week Seven: 28<sup>th</sup>July to 3<sup>rd</sup> September</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          As usual this sprint started with me feeling completely out of my
          depth and not sure that I was cut out for this, but thanks to the
          other weeks experiences I just let this sit and trusted the process. I
          managed to then get through the weeks work alright, did some pair
          coding (despite some vs code challenges making it a bit tricky for us
          to manage) which, as is nearly always the case, was a lot of fun. I
          enjoyed the wins that came with getting to world wide router and
          feeling like things were starting to come together more in my head.

        <h3>Weeks Eight to Ten: 4<sup>th</sup> to 26<sup>th</sup> September</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          While I thought I had the start of week eight before the theatre
          madness started it turned out that right from monday we were in the
          thick of it and from waking each am til bed each night for these weeks
          it was all theatre time! The girls did amazingly well with the
          busyness of the weeks. I ended up with a much bigger lighting job than
          I had expected! I learnt a lot though and really enjoyed it! The
          Legally Blonde shows were absolutely amazing, and for my eldest the
          looking after Arlo (the dog) backstage really filled her cup, my
          littlest became one of the teens at hang out time and was living her
          best life there, and my middlist was pretty please that my earlier
          statement of everyone needs to have some days and nights off came to
          nothing as it was actually all hands on deck! As always the girls were
          amazing help when it came to light setting and they blew the teachers
          and light tech away with this. After the Aladdin shows we all are very
          shattered and in need of a few days off, and then I very much look
          forward to swapping back from a lighting console to VS code.
