        <h3>Week one: 24<sup>th</sup> to 30<sup>th</sup> April</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          As last week had been very busy with the girls I had only got to
          computer set up on Sunday and then it threw a couple of curve balls my
          way. I found myself needing to post up a help request on the first
          morning, and then a second one later, which was a good exercise in
          both asking for help and recognising my ego struggles around not
          knowing a thing and being visible in it. This is definitely an area
          for me to be aware of and work on over this course. Once my comp was
          all set up and I was on to the course materials things went smoothly,
          I enjoyed making mistakes and then figuring out how to correct them.
          Having not worked in the command line at all before it was so fun to
          navigate that. One thing that has been interesting is working out how
          I am going with getting through the course work on time, I kept
          forgetting to set my toggl tracker or forgetting to turn it off, so
          this is a thing that I need to work on more. Balancing the girls
          needs, household needs and my needs this week has been easy. We have
          set up a table next to my desk so the girls can work alongside me
          which is pretty fun. The most challenging thing was probably us all
          getting off our workspaces when sitting down to do a little more after
          dinner and getting to bed at good hours.

        <h3>Week two: 1<sup>st</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> May</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          This week I started the week working on my values, strengths, and
          limitations blog post. I found it interesting that this was something
          that I was finding I had some blocks with getting started on, I found
          myself wanting to get through it and into playing with code again.
          When I sat with this, I came to realise that this was tied into not
          being sure how much we were expected to write and wanting to get it
          ‘right’. Identifying this helped me to move through the block and get
          my words down on paper. After this I checked had got all the
          reflections and finishing off things sorted for sprint-1 and as still
          had a couple days left in the sprint got into the stretch material
          which was good fun learning more about command line and working with a
          git repository. Then over the weekend I started to have a look at the
          sprint-2 work. The freecode camp tutorial was lots of fun to work
          through and so it quickly was completed. The devtools workshop was a
          little bit more challenging and I very much want to return to this
          next week to do some more work on it. I have been setting timers as
          well as using toggl and this has been great for being more aware of
          time spent on tasks. Outside of course work this week was a fairly
          standard week, the girls did more body-doubling with me, I am very
          much hoping this is not a novelty that wears off fast.

        <h3>Week three: 8<sup>th</sup> to 14<sup>th</sup> May</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          This week started out great, on Monday I got into creating my blog
          welcome page after thinking on the weekend about what I wanted to
          include in it. My focus was my want to see if I could create a
          functional navigation bar and work out how to link the pages, which
          after a few times of things not working how I thought it would and
          needing to play with changing things I did. Unfortunately, just after
          this I had a medical event which caused the rest of the week to be a
          write off for me where I was just resting and recovering. By the time
          Sunday came around I was really wanting to get back to having energy
          and focus to get back to the study and very looking forward to making
          time on Monday to get some done. This week has been a good lesson in
          putting myself first and not pushing through and keeping doing things.

        <h3>Week four: 15<sup>th</sup> to 21<sup>st</sup> May</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          It was great to feel up to getting back to study at the start of this
          week, however the state of the small and not so small humans in my
          life had the first two days a little challenging when it came to
          making time to get on the computer for more than 5minute blocks.
          Initially I felt the weight to get dones on Monday but then remembered
          that I am doing this course this way so that I can still be there for
          the kids and that I needed to trust myself and be realistic about the
          workload rather than putting my extra nice to learn stuff and
          experiment with stuff. I noticed over the course of the week that I
          tend to have one day where I am like woohoo I got this and then the
          next day I am more like hmmm I know nothing and will continue to know
          nothing unless I find all the hours. I have noticed this before when
          dealing with tricky situations so lucky I am pretty good at riding
          those waves. Later in the week things were more chill with the kiddos
          and while I didnt finish sprint-2 by Friday afternoon like I hoped to,
          I did get it to what felt like an acceptable point by later that
          night. Interestingly taking the pressure off by handing in what was
          hopefully good enough lead to me getting up early Saturday and
          improving on some of the code I was most unhappy with and doing more
          over the course of the day. The weekend was pretty hectic and loud
          here as it was the middliest birthday party and so she had 4 friends
          over Saturday for the night, with another joining the following
          morning for a time. Sunday afternoon and evening was chill and reset
          for the week for us. So I have not done the sprint-3 prep that was my
          plan but all and all feeling good.

        <h3>Week five: 22<sup>nd</sup> to 28<sup>th</sup> May</h3>
        <p class="textBlocks">
          On Monday two of the 5 kiddos came down with the flu and that ended up
          setting the tone for the week. While only three of the kids got it, it
          was a doozy so there was a lot of work to be done supporting the girls
          and slotting in course around that. I felt like I was waiting to be
          taken down but fortunately I wasn't and fortunately the eldest also
          managed to isolate from those that were sick and stay healthy, which
          she was very motivated to do as she had a weekend away booked. The
          core work was fun this week, it is lovely to get to know others in the
          cohort more. The JS challengers were great, I really enjoyed working
          out the last two loops, I the suggested resourses after have been
          great to work through. After learning more about ChatGBT I have been
          using that more to help me find those little errors driving me batty.
          Tis great!
