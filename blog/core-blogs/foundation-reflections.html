          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h3>
        <p>
          This has been so interesting to watch as going through the program so
          far, I didn't expect ego to feel at play with things like it has, I
          knew I would have imposter syndrome with group work but didn't think
          would have ego with it or apply to the blogs. I have found it so
          interesting with each of the blogs feeling ego struggles when it comes
          to posting them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the core learning has been really lovely as it has helped to
          reinforce some of the work that I have done and some of the advantages
          of the way I can be with learning new things and problem solving, it
          has been nice to celebrate my strengths and work with my weaknesses
          rather than feeling like I have to hide them or minimize them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through being more mindful around my study and time I have learnt more
          about how I dive into problems, I tend to like time to ponder over the
          problem and think it through then work on trying some things.

          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The play a big role, our values help to guide how we give our time to
          learning, and also how we go about programming. Empathy is important
          to show ourself and others in learning and programming as it is often
          challenging and so we need to show grace. Self-awareness is also
          important as we need to be aware of how we learn, how we work best and
          when we need to walk away for a little to be able to return and do our
          best.

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>I have been really surprised </p>
      </div>
      <div class="textBlocks">
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          Getting over my nerves about doing the listening and looping with
          others! Once I did that it was an awesome experience.</p>

      <div class="textBlocks">
        <h3>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h3>
        <p>
          To create better coders to then release on the world! And to set us up
          to get through challenges.
        </p>

      <div class="textBlocks">
        <h3>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming
          instead?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think it a good thing to include as it helps set us up better for
          when we are done our study and are working and needing to overcome
          issues and work with others.
