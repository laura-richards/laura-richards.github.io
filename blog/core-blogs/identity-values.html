        <h3>My Values</h3>
        <p>
          Key values of mine are empathy, creativity, integrity and connection.
          These help to shape the choices I make, the way I act and how I spend
          my time. My parenting journey has been a huge journey in learning
          about just who I am and what I stand for. Children are amazing mirrors
          helping to show us who we are, what has shaped us and where we fall
          short of our own values or understanding of ourselves in our actions.
          This journey has also led me to find groups with others with similar
          values which has helped me recognise and grown in the areas that are
          aligned with my values, such as La Leche League and Active Birth which
          both has a group ethos about supporting others where they are at with
          empathy and recognising that through connection and support people
          thrive. I grew up in an academic culture where a lot of value was
          placed on end products, where what you presented at the end and how
          you presented it was the most important thing. Yet over time have
          really come to value process over product when it comes to education,
          learning and creativity. There is so much to learn in the process of
          creating a thing and sometimes it gets nowhere but the magic really
          read what happened in the middle and how those involved learnt and
          grew.

        <h3>My Strengths</h3>
        <p>
          According to All Rights Strength Finder (find it
          <em
            ><a
              href="https://www.allright.org.nz/tools/strengths-finder"
              target="_blank"
              >here</a
            ></em
          >) my top five strengths are kindness, humour, creativity, gratitude
          and fairness. I checked in with a couple of friends to see if they
          thought that these were a good fit and they also agreed which was
          helpful! These strengths could support me in my learning journey as I
          will be able to use humour and gratitude to help keep myself going
          when things get tough for me. Creativity will support me when looking
          for solutions to problems. Kindness and fairness will help with
          working alongside others on this journey, and ideally I will also
          manage to apply both of them to myself when I am finding things
          difficult.

      <div>
        <h3 id="limitations">My Limitations</h3>
        <p>
          When looking at the bottom of my Strength Finder list I scored lowest
          in the qualities of prudence, spirituality, perseverance, leadership,
          and self-regulation. I feel like the perseverance does not quite fit
          here and is because some of the questions asked about finishing what
          started, and there are definitely plenty of crafty pursuits that I
          have started and then they are waiting on me patiently. I feel that
          when it comes to sticking at things that are tough kind of
          perseverance I have that. The others however are very valid, which was
          backed up again when checking in with others in my life. Although it
          was pointed out that while I shy way from leadership, that I do plenty
          of leading from behind (see my testimonial from Hone
          <a href="#testimonial"><em>here</em></a
          >, just be aware he is a writer so it is quite lengthy!).
          Self-regulation and leadership are the limitations with the most
          likelihood of impacting on my learning journey as working with others
          in a peer to peer way it will be most beneficial for me to not always
          defer to others to lead or drive the process, but instead for it to be
          that sometimes I take the lead on things. Self-regulation can have an
          impact in that sometimes I can get carried away in activities and
          forget to stop and eat, or can sink more time into an activity than it
          really merits. Another way this can be a limitation is when it comes
          to emotional regulations, as sometimes I can have a tendency to feel
          things bigger than really need to be at first than wind it back as I
          work through those feelings, which could come into play when
          struggling with difficult work or challenging group dynamics.

        <h3>Putting it in Action</h3>
        <p><strong>Following my moral and ethical compass</strong></p>
        <p>
          An example of a time where I made an ethical decision was when I was
          boarding with a friend while looking for a new rental and they
          suggested that we tell WINZ I was paying one amount for board so they
          would pay me more accommodation supplement, but that in reality I only
          pay her half of that amount, so that my budget would be easier to
          manage. I considered her offer, but at the end of the day my value of
          integrity and my moral compass just did not sit right with their
          suggestion so I went back to them and said thank you for the offer but
          I do not feel comfortable doing that. Making that call did feel
          difficult as I did not want to feel like in saying no I was judging
          them or not appreciating their attempt to support me, but it would
          have felt worse doing anything else. Going back I would make the same
          decision.
        </p>
        <p><strong>When things get tricky</strong></p>
        <p>
          An example of when I was trying to work productively with others but
          there was resistance was in a savings pool I was part of where there
          were differing ideas about how to operate. Tension arose when some
          wanted to approve all loans if there was funds in the account at this
          moment without to much attention paid to the security of the loans,
          where as I and some others wanted to ensure that we were doing due
          diligence with security for the loans and looking forward to make sure
          that we were not going to be in a situation that we would not have
          money in the account for scheduled outgoings later on. At the time I
          tried looking at their perspective with curiosity to find out what was
          behind it and see if I could apply it to my perspective more, so I
          asked questions and also pondered in my own time to help with this.
          Through this I discovered that the others had a strong want to be
          focused on the present and to trust others as their baseline which I
          could really understand, but at the same time I realised that for me I
          felt a strong sense of responsibility for those who had put their
          savings in the account and safeguarding their money and also their
          right to access the money when they told us they would need to. There
          was a lot of discussion had around how we wanted to operate and what
          the values of the group were and why, trying to find a way that
          respected both positions as much as possible.

      <h3>Testimonial for Laura Richards</h3>
      <p>
        I was going to write a standard testimonial, like “Hello, I’m writing in
        reference to Laura Richards, I’ve know Laura for many years, and she’s
        totally awesome. She’s totally good at all the things, and she’d be
        totally amazing at whatever it is you need her to do.” But I decided to
        do it a bit differently, because that’s what Laura would do. I first met
        Laura about 5 years ago? Is that right Laura? Something like that
        anyway. We’d known each other through a group of families we had in
        common. I knew her kids, she knew mine. But we never really got to know
        each other until a difficult event happened in Laura’s life. I wrote to
        her offering support, and she said yes. Not like “Thanks for the offer”,
        or “That’s kind of you”, or “Maybe” but “Yes”. Who does that? It turns
        out Laura does that. I was taken aback, and not really sure how to
        respond. Because, who does that? I should have known then that Laura was
        going to be different.
      </p>
      <p>
        Laura is a complicated person, like a seafood chowder. Like full of lots
        of different flavours and ideas, that you wouldn’t think would work
        together, but that create something wonderful. <sup>1</sup> She gentle and strong,
        opinionated and open minded. Intelligent and caring. And I get that none
        of those parings are mutually exclusive, but I’ve found that they do not
        often go well together, and yet, Laura. I’ve seen her build and grow the
        connections she needed for her business in an individualised and
        considerate way. Adapting to the needs of her clients, and their
        children. Leveraging her experience, her training, and her intuition<sup>2</sup>
        to create bespoke solutions to their problems. Always considering all
        the people involved, and their needs, so her solutions are equitable to
        all involved. I’ve seen her go out of her way to help people, friends,
        family, and strangers. I’ve watched her stand up to people who are not
        behaving as well as they could, holding them to the required standard.
        And I’ve seen her gently guide people, child and adult, through their
        crises. Offering support and advice as and when they needed. She gets
        people.
      </p>
      <p>
        She sees things most don’t see and has a depth of experience beyond her
        years. She’s navigated through more growth and change in the 5 years
        I’ve known her than most people decades older. And has guided her growth
        and the growth of her children through all of it better than I thought
        possible. I’ve learned more from her and been guided more in my own
        growth than I could have imagined. Both by example and by gentle
        encouragement.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think her greatest strengths are in her creativity and attention to
        detail. Her open mindedness and flexibility. And her caring. There are
        few people I’ve met who care as much, for as many, as Laura does. I have
        rarely felt as supported and seen as I have in her company. She
        communicates well and holds space for others. Her creativity is not just
        artistic, but also in problem solving. Leveraging her intelligence and
        experience to find solutions, and guide those around her to those
        solutions. I don’t know if she would call herself a leader, but I’ve
        seen her organise and take control of situations that the official
        leader is letting get out of hand. And I’ve seen experienced leaders put
        her in charge of critical responsibilities after knowing her for only a
        short time. It’s a quiet, supportive, gap filling kind of leadership
        from within.
      </p>
      <p>
        Laura’s values are grounded in, but not constrained by the normal social
        cultural mores we all share. She has the usual good moral stuff, obey
        the laws, be nice to people etc. But they are not unconsidered, close
        minded, or slavish beliefs. But instead, a considered and reconsidered
        evaluation of the sense of these mores. And I’ve frequently witnessed
        her widening her horizons and adjusting her beliefs as required when
        evidence in her life proves re-evaluation is necessary. She is not
        afraid of change, or a challenge. She drives changes in her own life
        with determination and courage. She meets challenges head on and does
        not back down in the face of adversity. She is tenacious and committed
        in reaching her goals and the goals of those she is working with. In
        short, she’s super and I’m better for knowing her.

        <sup>1</sup> In all honesty, I’m not really a fan of seafood chowder,
        but it’s a great metaphor. And I am a fan of a great metaphor.
      </p>

      <p>
        <sup>2</sup> I don’t mean intuition in a spiritual sense, more her
        ability to pull all her experience and observations together to leap to
        inspired solutions
