      <div>
        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>This is a bit of a work in progress at the moment, but I guess when I
          break it down to a basic level of what I would like to, I want to work
          on products or services that make a meaningful difference to peoples
          lives, or improve others lives.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What are your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Strengths</strong> -My strengths when it comes to learning are
          my love of learning and my curious nature. Both of these have me keen
          to keep learning and dive into lessons and activities. They can also
          make it a little difficult not to go down rabbit holes so I do need
          to keep and eye on that.
          <br />
          <strong>Limitations</strong> -My limitations when it comes to learning are my
          tendency to procrastinate if I am not sure on something, my challenge asking for 
          help, and the related struggle to be seen doing something wrong. I am aware that 
          for this course I need to be really mindful of all of these and work on overcoming them.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What skills (human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev-Academy?</h3>
          <p> Following on from my limitations I would like to work on being less in a place of ego when it comes to
            not knowing something, and so work on asking for help, and putting myself forward and taking a risk when
            I could possibly be wrong. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme:</h3>
          <p>I will engage respectfully and mindfully with others, ensuring I do what I say I will when I say I will, or I will communicate 
            if I can't for any reason. I will do my best to ensure I am dedicating adequate time to course work and engage support when required. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h3>
          <p>If I notice I am stuck on a problem for more than 20minutes and I have covered the individual problem solving techniques myself,
            I will seek help from my peers and facilitators through using the appropriate discord channel, or the helpdesk if appropriate. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
          <p>I have a lot of faith in our wonderful facilitation team. I expect them to continue to provide feedback, support and encouragement.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Scheduling information</h3>
          <p>My life is pretty wonderfully chaotic so scheduling is interesting, with 5 kids at mine during work hours. Mostly 
            with some notice I can make myself available as I can set the girls up. One exception to this is Thursdays from 2-6 when I 
          support the teachers at a Musical Theatre class. In September I will also have a couple of weeks where my availability is very limited due to 
        supporting at the shows for that same class. </p>
