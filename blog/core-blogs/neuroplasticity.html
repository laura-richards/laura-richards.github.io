            Previously it was thought that once you are out of childhood your
            brain is done changing and growing, but we have learnt that actually
            throughout life your brain can change and grow, sometimes is very
            impressive ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning this has been of benefit to those with brain injuries,
            depression and many other conditions or experiences because we no
            longer thought that any brain conditions were set and so rehab was
            more likely to be attempted and supported. When we understand it we
            are more likely to do the things to support or learning and growth
            for ourselves but also for others.
          </p>

            <strong
              >How might we use neuroplasticity to benefit ourselves?</strong
            >
            By being aware both that we can change dysfunctional thought
            patterns, and also ways to support our own neuroplasticity to
            increase learning, memory and growth we can create benefits for
            ourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How do we increase our neuroplasticity?</strong> One of the
            best ways is physical activity as it helps stimulate the release of
            brain-derived neurotropic factor(BDNF) which aides in the growth of
            new synaptic connections and strengthens signals from neuron to
            neuron, which promotes mental and behavioural flexibility.
          </p>
          <p>Other way to improve neuroplasticity include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="bullet-points">
              Practice practice practice! both in your head and in real life!
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-points">
              Do things in novel ways, ie different from your normal way
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-points">Be playful!</li>
            <li class="bullet-points">
              Keep trying new things and engaging in stimulating activities
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-points">Engaging in mindfullness activities</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <div class="textBlocks">
          <p>
            <strong>What is Growth Mindset?</strong> Growth mindset is a way of
            viewing our skills, talents and capabilities as able to be improved
            rather than set in stone. It is a way of viewing challenges and
            setbacks, we can either see that with work we can overcome them, or
            we can think that our skills are set and so we can't.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why is it relevant?</strong> Having a growth mindset can
            change how we approach challenges and help us stay motivated in our
            work.
          </p>
          <p><strong>How to cultivate a growth mindset:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li class="bullet-points">
              Be aware of language you are using, avoid fixed statements, and
              use things like 'not yet'
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-points">Find the positives</li>
            <li class="bullet-points">Embrace setbacks</li>
            <li class="bullet-points">Ask for help when need it</li>
            <li class="bullet-points">Embrace the process</li>
          </ul>

            <strong>Neuroplasticity</strong>
            One interesting takeaway for me from reading about neuroplasticity
            is that physically activity is important for brain health, I knew
            that getting out and active can be really helpful of mental health,
            but having it more clearly in a brain health article has reminded me
            that while doing this study I need to remember to take time to be
            active for not only my body and mental health, but also to support
            myself being as able to learn as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tend to be a person who practices things in my head so it is cool
            to know that this is helpful and something to continue doing as I
            learn more and come across challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Growth Mindset</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The most interesting thing I learnt and also the thing that I think
            will make the most difference if I can implement it in my learning
            strategies is self-advocacy. I knew that seeking support was a skill
            I needed to develop in this, but seeing it as part of growth mindset
            has reminded me of its importance.
